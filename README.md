# Certification Notes

I'm trying something new: learning how to learn. There's a ton of work that I need to get done and even more learning to do, but I'm finding convensional methods don't work anymore. 

So, as an experiment, I've decided to document my new learning processes and create an archive of notes and tips for each certification / technology I need to complete in the upcoming months.  

This is how I've managed to learn effectively.

### My Method Explained

There are many strategies for learning how to learn, but for me, it simply comes down to simplicity: 

1. Understand what you are about to learn (**familiarize**)
2. See it visually - preferably a video (**orientate**)
3. Follow it up with reading/text (**enforce**)
4. Hands-on real world implementation of what you are learning (**practice**)
4. Go to bed (**diffuse**)

It sounds strange, but the `go to bed` part is called [diffused learning](https://staciechoice1010.wordpress.com/2014/08/08/focused-vs-diffused-mode/) and for me, its kind of like waking up with a new super power. 

Understanding what you are about to learn is vitality important because you will likely be less intimidated and hence, more receptive. A simple way to do this is to watch a quick or somewhat in-depth video about the topic you are attempting to learn. A 5000-mile view of the entire course or skill would be perfect at this stage.
