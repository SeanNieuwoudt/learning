# Learning Notes

I'm trying something new: learning how to learn. There's a ton of work that I need to get done and even more learning to do, but I'm finding conventional methods don't work anymore.

So, as an experiment, I've decided to document my new learning processes and create an archive of notes and tips for each certification / technology or subject I need to complete in the next year.

At the time of writing this, I am already proficient in some of these topics, but not at a level that I am happy with.

Hopefully, this process would allow me to learn effectively.

## My Learning Method Summary

There are many strategies for learning how to learn, but for me, it simply comes down to simplicity, understanding and immediate application:

1. Understand what you are about to learn (**familiarize**)
2. See it visually - preferably an explainer video (**orientate**)
3. Hands-on real world implementation of what you are learning (**practice**)
4. Follow it up with reading/text/research (**enforce**)
5. Go to bed (**diffuse**)

It sounds strange, but the `go to bed` part is called [diffused learning](https://staciechoice1010.wordpress.com/2014/08/08/focused-vs-diffused-mode/) and for me, it's kind of like waking up the next morning with a new super power.

Understanding the larger concept of what you are about to learn is vitality important because you will likely be less intimidated and therefore more receptive. A simple way to do this is to watch either a quick or somewhat in-depth video about the topic you are attempting to learn. A 5000-mile view of the entire course or skill would be perfect at this stage. It help's by removing the unknown from it (there are no bad surprises - like geometry).
Since you will no longer be left spending energy on worrying about what you are not seeing or whats coming next, you can spend that time focussing on the learning at hand.

For adults to learn effectively, we need a pressing need and immediate application of the skill we're attempting to learn otherwise it will be forgotten almost as fast as we've picked up the skill.

#### Familiarize

This is a crucial step in the process of learning. Jumping right in to the meaty content of the topic you want to learn is much more difficult than it could be if you spend a day or two familiarizing yourself
with the overall topic at hand.

The human mind is a scary place and we're wired to be afraid or at least apprehensive of the unknown (see where this is going?).

#### Orientate

Orientating yourself is closely tied to familiarization with the topic. They are generally performed asynchronously and are both a result of one another.

It can be quite trivial to watch a 10 minute video on Youtube about something you want to learn to get a sense of the requirements and outcomes.

The key difference between familiarization and orientation is this:

- Familiarization: reading and researching
- Orientation: watching a video where someone else is explaining it to you.

#### Practice

Once you have started learning a topic, I find it best to immediate practice the skill and jump straight into the deep end. For me personally, it works best if I learn the basics and then jump straight to the toughest parts of the skill and then work my way backwards. Practicing daily solidifies the knowledge and also creates the visual anchor your brain needs to remember something by.

#### Enforce

Most people stop learning after the practice step because they generally feel "good enough" to move forward. The problem with this is that you have not yet challenged your own assumptions or received decisive confirmation about what you've been learning.

I find that this step of enforcing and acknowledgement acts as the backup or confirmation to something that you've been learning. It also adds a bit of theory to the physical skill and therefore a more complete picture.

#### Diffuse

This would undoubtedly be my favourite part and requires no real effort on your part. It's well know that sleep is good for you, but what most people don't know is that your brain continues to work while you are asleep. Ever had one of those "aha!" moments first thing in the morning where you've managed to solve a problem you were struggling with the day before?

Well, this is called Diffused Learning and there's lots of research available online about the topic. The trick is to learn just before you go to bed at night.
