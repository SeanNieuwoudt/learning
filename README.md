# Learning Notes

I'm trying something new: learning how to learn. There's a ton of work that I need to get done and even more learning to do, but I'm finding convensional methods don't work anymore.

So, as an experiment, I've decided to document my new learning processes and create an archive of notes and tips for each certification / technology or subject I need to complete in the upcoming months.  

At the time of writing this, I am already proficient in some of these topics, but not at a level that I am happy with.

Hopefully, this process would allow me to learn effectively.

### My Learning Method Explained

There are many strategies for learning how to learn, but for me, it simply comes down to simplicity, understanding and immediate application:

1. Understand what you are about to learn (**familiarize**)
2. See it visually - preferably an explainer video (**orientate**)
3. Follow it up with reading/text/research (**enforce**)
4. Hands-on real world implementation of what you are learning (**practice**)
4. Go to bed (**diffuse**)

It sounds strange, but the `go to bed` part is called [diffused learning](https://staciechoice1010.wordpress.com/2014/08/08/focused-vs-diffused-mode/) and for me, it's kind of like waking up the next morning with a new super power.

Understanding the larger concept of what you are about to learn is vitality important because you will likely be less intimidated and therefore more receptive. A simple way to do this is to watch either a quick or somewhat in-depth video about the topic you are attempting to learn. A 5000-mile view of the entire course or skill would be perfect at this stage. It help's by removing the unknown from it (there are no bad surprises - like geometry).
Since you will no longer be left spending energy on worrying about what you are not seeing or whats coming next, you can spend that time focussing on the learning at hand.

For adults to learn effectively, we need a pressing need and immediate application of the skill we're attempting to learn otherwise it will be forgotten almost as fast as we've picked up the skill.
