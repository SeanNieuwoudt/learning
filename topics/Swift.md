# Swift

## Variables & Constants

Swift variables can be re-assigned.
Constancts cannot be changed after being initialized.
Types are inferred, but you can explicitly declare it by using `var myvar: type = value`

Variables start with `var` and constants start with `let`

## Notes:

- Statements can be separated with a semi-colon
- String interpolation uses `My name is \(var)`
- Code written at a global level is treated as the entry point of the program so you dont need a `main()` function
- 


### Optionals

Optional variables can either contain a value or nil. To mark a variable as optional, you use the `?`.
